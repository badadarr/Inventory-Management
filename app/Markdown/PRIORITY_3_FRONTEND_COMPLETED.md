## 📱 Component Props & Emits

### PurchaseOrder/Index.vue
**Props:**
```javascript
{
  purchaseOrders: Object (paginated data),
  filters: Object (filter values)
}
```

### LowStockWidget.vue
**Props:** None (fetches data internally)

**Internal State:**
```javascript
{
  lowStockProducts: Array,
  loading: Boolean,
  showAll: Boolean
}
```

### CustomPriceModal.vue
**Props:**
```javascript
{
  show: Boolean,

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### 1. **Auto-Refresh Logic**
- Low Stock Widget fetches on component mount
- Purchase Order Index refreshes after receive
- Stock Movement is read-only (auto-created)

### 2. **Conditional Rendering**
- Receive button only shows for pending POs
- Edit button only shows for pending POs
- Delete button hidden for received POs

### 3. **Permission Handling**
Components don't enforce permissions yet. Need to add:
```javascript
// Example: Check user role
if (user.role !== 'admin' && user.role !== 'warehouse') {
  // Hide receive button
}
```

### 4. **Toast Notifications**
All components use:
```javascript
import { showToast } from '@/Utils/Helper.js';
showToast('Message', 'success|error|warning');
```

### 5. **Route Names**
Ensure these routes are registered:
```javascript
route('purchase-orders.index')
route('purchase-orders.create')
route('purchase-orders.edit', id)
route('purchase-orders.receive', id)
route('stock-movements.index')
route('products.low-stock')
route('product-customer-prices.upsert')
```
